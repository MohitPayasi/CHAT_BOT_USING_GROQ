# CHAT_BOT_USING_GROQ
 Q&amp;A Chatbot using Groq, LangChain &amp; Streamlit
This project is an advanced Question-Answering chatbot built with LangChain, Streamlit, and the lightning-fast Groq API, which powers next-gen large language models like LLaMA 3 and Mixtral. The chatbot takes natural language input from the user, processes it intelligently using LangChainâ€™s prompt handling, and fetches ultra-fast responses from Groq's inference engine.

The goal of this project is to create a high-performance chatbot experience using open-source LLMs that rival GPT-4 in capabilities but offer significantly faster and more cost-effective inference. Thanks to Groqâ€™s hardware acceleration, models like llama3-70b-8192 or mixtral-8x7b-32768 can provide sub-second response times.

The chatbot runs in a clean, minimal frontend powered by Streamlit, making it easy to use, test, and customize. You can ask it general knowledge questions, use it as a code helper, or connect it to your own datasets for advanced use cases.
